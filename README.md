# Anima
Condensing the harmonic lessons of the cloud into the nano realm.

The goal of the Anima project is to create a distributed data procesing engine capible of running on small embedded micro computers.  This allows the lessons learned from distributed process and cloud to apply to the emergeing world of ubiquitous micro-computing.

**Note:** The scope of the anima project has been substantially reduced due to overlap with the Robot OS project, and discontinuation of grant-funded work. Thus, only the driver code is updated.

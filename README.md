Condensing the harmonic lessons of the cloud into the nano realm.

The goal of the Anima project is to create a distributed data procesing engine capible of running on small embedded micro computers.  This allows the lessons learned from distributed process and cloud to apply to the emergeing world of ubiquitous micro-computing.
